# TypeScript Development Best Practices

## Type Safety
TypeScript provides compile-time type checking to catch errors early in development. Always use strict mode and avoid `any` types when possible.

## Code Organization
- Use modules and namespaces appropriately
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use interfaces to define contracts
- Leverage generics for reusable code

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize bundle size
- Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Optimize build processes with webpack
- Profile and monitor runtime performance
