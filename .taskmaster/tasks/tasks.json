        "details": "This task involves implementing the UI component that allows users to select a block and displays a handle or control that can be clicked to initiate deletion. The implementation should:\n\n1. Add event listeners to detect when a user selects or focuses on a block\n2. Create and display a block handle UI element when a block is selected\n3. Position the handle appropriately relative to the selected block\n4. Style the handle to be visually distinct and intuitive\n\nCode considerations:\n```javascript\n// Example implementation approach\nfunction initializeBlockHandles() {\n  const blocks = document.querySelectorAll('.block');\n  \n  blocks.forEach(block => {\n    block.addEventListener('focus', () => showBlockHandle(block));\n    block.addEventListener('click', () => showBlockHandle(block));\n  });\n}\n\nfunction showBlockHandle(block) {\n  // Remove any existing handles\n  removeExistingHandles();\n  \n  // Create handle element\n  const handle = document.createElement('div');\n  handle.classList.add('block-handle');\n  handle.setAttribute('data-block-id', block.id);\n  \n  // Position handle appropriately\n  positionHandleRelativeToBlock(handle, block);\n  \n  // Add to DOM\n  document.body.appendChild(handle);\n}\n```",

Add event listeners to block handles to detect clicks\n2. Implement the deletion logic to remove the entire block (not just its contents)\n3. Handle any cleanup required after block deletion\n4. Ensure proper focus management after deletion\n\nCode considerations:\n```javascript\nfunction initializeBlockHandleListeners() {\n  document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n    if (event.target.classList.contains('block-handle')) {\n      const blockId = event.target.getAttribute('data-block-id');\n      deleteBlock(blockId);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nfunction deleteBlock(blockId) {\n  const block = document.getElementById(blockId);\n  \n  if (block) {\n    // Optional: Confirm deletion with user\n    // const confirmDelete = confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this block?');\n    // if (!confirmDelete) return;\n    \n    // Remove the block from the DOM\n    block.remove();\n    \n    // Clean up any references to the block\n    cleanupBlockReferences(blockId);\n    \n    // Set focus to appropriate element\n    setFocusAfterDeletion();\n    \n    // Trigger any necessary state updates\n    updateApplicationState();\n  }\n}\n```",
